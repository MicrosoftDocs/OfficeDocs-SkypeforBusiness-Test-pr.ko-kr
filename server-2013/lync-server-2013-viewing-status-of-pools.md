# Viewing status of pools in Lync Server 2013

 

_**마지막으로 수정된 항목:** 2014-05-01_

For each Enterprise Pool and the pool of each Standard Edition Server, you can view information about pool status and the status of other components used by the pool through the Lync Server 2013 제어판. We recommended implementing System Center Operations Manager 2012 with the Lync Server 제어판 to help administrators in viewing the health of pools within their environment.

## View pools

1.  Using the Lync Server 제어판, open the Lync Server 제어판.

2.  Click Topology, and check status of all servers in the Topology.
